					<h3>The Beginning</h3>
					<p>
						The development of HTML is closely related to the evolution of the
						Internet. The undisputed creator of the language, which was meant to be an
						easy way of publishing content on the future of the web, is also the
						founder of the Internet. Sir Tim Berners-Lee is responsible for creating
						the language which was done as a way of making it easier for systems to
						communicate with each other. Even when the language was
						founded, he understood that in the future there will be many different
						publishers hence making it a part of the long tradition of Internet
						improvements up till that time. Developer versions were released through
						which it would eventually become the backbone which allows users to see
						content as well as publish data effectively allowing servers around the
						world to communicate in the same language as well.
					</p>
					<h3>The Evolution</h3>
					<p>
						One of the most important phases was related to development after support
						had been finished in 1996. After the support period was over, Web browsers
						such as Netscape were working towards giving active feedback to the
						community around implementation of features. This was also being done
						consistently by companies themselves which were creating new features to
						make the Internet experience more lively and immersive. The first phase 
						of Internet development was mostly textbased, which
						did not explore the full functionality of the markup language. It was only
						through the development of video and textbased data, that the Internet was
						able to portray many different mediums, and also allowing HTML to become
						much more functional and expansive. The latest version of HTML is
						currently known as HTML 5. Looking at the code present, it is clear that
						this new form of HTML is extremely dynamic in nature focusing more on its
						ability to maintain design and form in mobile-based applications as well.
					</p>
					<h3>HTML 5</h3>
					<p>
						The first version of HTML was introduced as HTML 2. This was first
						published in November 1995. The next iteration came with version 3 which
						was released two years later. The first iteration was also released the
						same year as ever many significant developments taking place from a court
						perspective. However, the next big update would only come in
						2014, which is also when HTML 5 became the standard across devices. The
						dynamic capabilities of the language have enhanced immensely allowing it
						to play video as well as other types of content effectively without taking
						up too much space and also allowing elements such as CSS to become more
						effective creating an overall user experience which excites and thrills at
						the same time. Future iterations of HTML are expected to increase these
						capabilities to the next level and make websites more immersive and do
						more.

					<h3>Demonstration</h3>
					<p>
						HTML consists of a series of elements that can be used to build website. A well-strucutred webpage should utilize 
						HTML elements to organize the content, making the website more neat. There are elements with dedicated tag help to 
						sectionize the webpage. Besides, there are elements that help to enrich the content of websites. For example,
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>&nbsp;&lt;image&gt;<br>
							<img src="images/image2.jpg">
						</li>

						<li>&nbsp;&lt;link&gt;<br>
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" target="_blank" id="hyperlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit</a>
						</li>

						<li>&nbsp;&lt;table&gt;<br>
							<table border="1">
								<tr>
									<th>Fruit</th>
									<th>Quantity</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Mango</td>
									<td>3</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Watermelon</td>
									<td>5</td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</li>
						<li>&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;<br>
							<ul>Fruits
								<li>Mango</li>
								<li>Watermelon</li>
								<li>Guava</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<br>

					<p>
						HTML also provides form-like elements to allow web users to fill in information and to submit to the website.
						For example,
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							&nbsp;&lt;textarea&gt;<br>
							<textarea rows="5" cols="50"></textarea>
						</li>

						<li>
							&nbsp;&lt;select&gt;<br>
							<select>
								<option value="Mango">Mango</option>
								<option value="Watermelon">Watermelon</option>
								<option value="Grape">Grape</option>
								<option value="Banana">Banana</option>
							</select>
						</li>
						

						<li>&nbsp;&lt;input&gt; <br> This tag allow different type of input such as:
							<ul>
								<li>
									checkbox :-
									<input type="checkbox" name="cMango" value="Mango">Mango	
									<input type="checkbox" name="cWatermelon" value="Watermelon">Watermelon
									<input type="checkbox" name="cGrape" value="Grape">Grape
								</li>
								<li>
									type=text :-
									<input type="text" value="">	
								</li>
								<li>
									type=radio :-
									<input type="radio"  name="rfruits" value="Mango">Mango
									<input type="radio"  name="rfruits" value="Watermelon">Watermelon
									<input type="radio"  name="rfruits" value="Grape">Grape
								</li>

								<li>
									type=password :-
									<input type="password"  name="ipassword" value="">
								</li>

								<li>
									type=file :-
									<input type="file"  name="ifile" value="">
								</li>

								<li>
									type=submit :-
									<input type="submit"  name="btnSubmit" value="Submit">
								</li>

								<li>
									type=date :-
									<input type="date" name="idate" value="">
								</li>

								<li>
									type=Search :-
									<input type="Search" name="btnSearch" value="Search">
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>

						<b>HTML elements in this website</b><br>
						The building block of this website is HTML as well.
						As previously mentioned, there are elements with dedicated tag help to sectionize the webpage. 
						For example, below are the different sections of this page :
						<b>&lt;header&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;nav&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;footer&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;div&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h2&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h3&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h4&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h5&gt;</b>,
						<b>&lt;h6&gt;</b>
						('h' referring to headers of different sizes)
					</p>

					<p>
						If you visit my Biography page, you can see that there are several images and tables
						with invisible borders (which states my skills with stars). HTML are the basic building blocks of this 
						tables and image frame too ! (but not the image, those are pulled from some where else)
