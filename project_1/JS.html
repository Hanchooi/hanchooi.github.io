					<h3>Impetus</h3>
					<p>
						JavaScript was first developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich the prototype of
						which he had created in 10 days. The motivation for developing a new
						language, which was mostly driven by Netscape and Sun systems was to
						develop a language which would help augment many of the shortfalls of
						using HTML. Even though HTML was extremely useful in
						displaying information between different devices, it was not useful or not
						enough for it to be dynamic in nature and also create better connection
						with the servers. The unique aspect about JavaScript is that it works on
						both ends to create an extremely holistic experience allowing for the
						development of web applications which are unique and able to take
						thousands of different data points to create user experiences as well as
						websites which makes sense.
					</p>
					<h3>Progress</h3>
					<p>
						In 2000, the first popular JavaScript framework was released. It was
						called Dynamic HTML (DHTML). DHTML was used to make basic changes to web
						pages. The sort of changes you would make with CSS easily these days.
						DHTML was released in 2000. In 2006, a lot of frameworks and libraries
						were released. The most popular being jQuery. jQuery was created to help
						developers build sophisticated web pages. This framework is
						quite powerful, challenging the issues faced by developers with the subtle
						differences in browser implementations. jQuery also abstracted all of the
						complexity of client-side web development at the same time, making it easy
						for developers to learn and use. For server side development, node.js is  
						one of the most powerful tool available.
					</p>
					<h3>Triumph</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="Radio.garden" style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 0rem;">Radio.garden</a> 
						is one good example that has show case the power of JavaScript. 
						The website allows the user to choose any streaming radio around the world by allowing
						them to zoom in and out on their preferred location and understand how the
						different stations are mapped. In other words, it uses information from
						geolocation as well as the existing database in place to create an
						immersive experience for the user. The user is able to zoom in and out
						which is an aspect of the flexibility of the language. On the server side,
						a company which is using the capabilities of node.js is Linkedin.
						Previously, LinkedIn uses ROR based app, which was synchronous in nature
						due to which system was bursting as its seams. However, with the use of
						JavaScript the company was able to overcome this and allow millions of
						users to interact with the website efficiently with exactly the same user
						experience. Before the implementation of JavaScript, the
						company was not able to deliver the user experience and the fast response
						that it was expecting. However, this was mostly due to the limitations of
						the previous languages which were being used to try to sync up information
						between the front end and the servers to allow for better communication
						and faster response time.

				<!-- div 2 is about Javascript Demonstration  -->
				<div id="div2">
					<h3>Demonstration</h3>
					<p>Example usages of Javascript:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Validate user input
							<ul>
								<li>
									Name: <span style="color: red">*</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
									<input type="text" id="iName" value="">
									<input type="button" onclick="chkMandatory(1)" value="Submit">
								</li>
								<li>
									Age: &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;
									<input type="text" id="iAge" value="">
									<input type="button" onclick="chkMandatory(2)" value="Submit">
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							Manipulating DOM
							<ul>
								<li>
									Remove and insert HTML element upon user action:
									<br>
									<select onchange="showModel()" name="vMobile">
										<option value="">Please Select</option>
										<option value="Samsung">Samsung</option>
										<option value="iPhone">iPhone</option>
									</select>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="Available_Model"></span>
								</li>
								<li>
									Call javascript function to calculate user input:
									<br>
									<input type="text" name="aVal1" value="0" onchange="calculate()"> +
									<input type="text" name="aVal2" value="0" onchange="calculate()">
									&nbsp;
									<span>Total</span> : <span id="showtotal"></span>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							Change css style<br>
							Font color:
							<select id="chg_css_color" onchange="ChangeCss()">
								<option value="">Please Select</option>
								<option value="Red">Red</option>
								<option value="Blue">Blue</option>
								<option value="Yellow">Yellow</option>
							</select><br>
							Font Type:
							<select id="chg_css_type" onchange="ChangeCss()">
								<option value="">Please Select</option>
								<option value="Montserrat">Montserrat</option>
								<option value="Verdana">Verdana</option>
								<option value="Sacramento">Sacramento</option>
							</select><br>

							<span id="showcss">Hello World!</span>
						</li>

						<li>Call Ajax to send and retrieve data from server asynchronously without reloading the web page.(Refer Table below)</li>
						<li>Set Timer to call javascript function. It is also useful for ajax function as it can make the website update the content periodically.</li>
						<p>The retrieved data from website (https://coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/v2/locations) will be populated into 
						the table below when user click button "Fetch Data" or "Fetch Data Periodically". 
						</p>
						<p>User action: <span id="TableMsg"></span></p>
						<table id="coronavirus-table" class="table" width="100%">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>NO</th>
									<th>COUNTRY</th>
									<th>COUNTRY POPULATION</th>
									<th>PROVINCE</th>
									<th>LAST UPDATED DATE</th>

									<th>CONFIRMED</th>
									<th>DEATHS</th>
									<th>RECOVERED</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<br>
						<div class="AjaxButton" style="text-align: center">
							<!-- loadCovidData(0), pass 0 value into the function to clearinterval()  -->
							<span><input type="button" onclick="JavaScript:loadCovidData(0);showUserAction(1);" value="Fetch Data"></span>
							<!-- loadCovidDataWTime(5), pass 5 value into the function, number of running of this function to limit 5 time  -->
							<span><input type="button" onclick="JavaScript:loadCovidDataWTime(5);showUserAction(2);" value="Fetch Data Periodically"></span>
							<!-- removeData(), to remove all the data in table  -->
							<span><input type="button" onclick="JavaScript:removeData();showUserAction(3);" value="Clear"></span>
						</div>
					</ol>

					<p>
						After knowing the basic of javascript and what javascript can do.Hereby, we will discuss about a javascript library named JQuery.
						JQuery is one of the most popular javascript libary. JQuery make javascript coding much more easy and simple.
						It has a lot of features such as manipulating DOM ,Change css style and Call Ajax. JQuery is convenient of manipulating 
						DOM as it contain many methods that help it to access HTML elements. 
						The example of data fetch above is using JQuery to populate data into the table as well.
						<br>
						Sample code:
						<br>
						&emsp;$("#coronavirus-table > tbody").append("&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;");
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li><b>$("#coronavirus-table > tbody")</b> &emsp; To access &lt;tbody&gt; of table with id=coronavirus-table </li>
							<li><b>.append("&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;")</b> &emsp; To append &lt;tr&gt; into the &lt;tbody&gt; of table</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

					<h3>Uses of JavaScript in this Website</h3>
					Remember the button that make all CSS styling dissapear ? 
					(If you didn't notice, it's right there around the bottom of CSS's page.)
					That button's function is made with JavaScript too !
